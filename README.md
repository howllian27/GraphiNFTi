# Overview of GraphiNFTi
<p align="justify">Graphinfti is a project aimed at revolutionizing the digital representation of real and fictional environments. Leveraging advanced computational algorithms for procedural generation and 3D modeling, it seeks to automate and refine the process of creating intricate, dynamic, and visually rich environments, bringing an unprecedented level of detail and realism to the virtual world. The project is spearheaded by a dual approach, accompanied by a proof-of-concept approach for the smart contract verification of digital passports on the Algorand blockchain: </p>

## 1. Procedurally Generated City (WFC Algorithm with Backtracking)
<b>Technical Overview: </b>
<p align="justify">This portion of the project revolves around the concept of procedural generation, a method where a large amount of content is generated algorithmically rather than manually. It takes advantage of an existing Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm combined with a backtracking strategy. Our team attempted to blend in a variety of 3D models created from 2D NFT images to enhance the architectural landscapes of the procedural generation. More information about the original project is available at <a>https://github.com/marian42/wavefunctioncollapse</a></p>

<p align="justify">WFC operates by collapsing a wave function through the observation of quantum mechanics, translating this phenomenon into 3D space to create intricate and realistic cityscapes dynamically. The backtracking element ensures that the algorithm can efficiently navigate through different pathways during the generation process, effectively preventing dead-ends and promoting a cohesive layout. </p>

## 2. 3D Model Generation from 2D Images (Stable Diffusion)
<b>Technical Overview: </b>
This portion is grounded on the stable diffusion methodology, a sophisticated process that derives 3D models from 2D images. It employs a series of Python scripts and auxiliary modules to process 2D image data through mathematical and geometric transformations to craft detailed 3D models.

The stable diffusion process is somewhat a representation of a diffusion process where you allow an image to undergo transformations using predefined algorithms to get a 3D representation.
